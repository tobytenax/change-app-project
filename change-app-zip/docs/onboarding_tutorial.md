## Getting Started

### Creating Your Account

1. Visit the Change App website or open the mobile app
2. Click on "Register" to create a new account
3. Fill in your details:
   - Username (this will be visible to other users)
   - Email address (for notifications and account recovery)
   - Password (make sure it's secure)
   - Full name
   - Location information (neighborhood, city, state, region, country)
4. Click "Sign Up" to create your account
5. You'll receive a welcome message and 1 Acent to start participating

### Navigating the Interface

The main navigation menu includes:
- **Dashboard**: Your personal overview
- **Proposals**: Browse and search for proposals
- **Create Proposal**: Submit new proposals (requires 5 Acents)
- **Profile**: Manage your account and view transaction history

## Understanding the Dual-Currency System

The Change App uses two types of digital tokens:

### Acents

- **What they are**: Competence-based tokens that represent knowledge and expertise
- **How to earn them**:
  - Passing quizzes (1 Acent per quiz)
  - Voting after passing a quiz (1 Acent per vote)
  - Having your comments integrated into proposals
  - Having your proposal receive "yes" votes (1 Acent per vote)
- **How to spend them**:
  - Creating proposals (5 Acents)
  - Other platform features as they develop

### Dcents

- **What they are**: Delegation-based tokens that represent participation
- **How to earn them**:
  - Delegating your vote to someone else (1 Dcent)
  - Receiving delegated votes (1 Dcent per delegation)
  - Voting on comments (1 Dcent per vote)
  - Receiving upvotes on your comments (1 Dcent per upvote)
- **How to spend them**:
  - Creating non-competent comments (3 Dcents)
  - Other platform features as they develop

### The "Alchemical" Conversion

Dcents can be converted to Acents through the comment system:
- When your non-competent comment receives enough upvotes, it may be integrated into the proposal
- Upon integration, some of your Dcents are converted to Acents
- This represents the community recognizing the value of your contribution despite not having passed the competence quiz

## Browsing and Voting on Proposals

### Finding Proposals

1. Click on "Proposals" in the main navigation
2. Use filters to narrow down proposals by:
   - Scope (neighborhood, city, state, region, country, global)
   - Status (active, closed, escalated)
   - Location

### Understanding Proposal Details

Each proposal includes:
- Title and content
- Author information
- Scope and location
- Current voting results
- Comments and discussion
- Quiz link (if you haven't passed it yet)

### Voting on Proposals

To vote on a proposal:
1. Open the proposal details page
2. If you've passed the quiz:
   - Click "Vote Yes" or "Vote No"
   - You'll earn 1 Acent for voting
3. If you haven't passed the quiz:
   - You'll need to either take the quiz or delegate your vote

## Taking Quizzes and Competence Verification

### Why Quizzes Matter

Quizzes ensure that voters understand the proposal before voting directly. This helps maintain the quality of decision-making.

### Taking a Quiz

1. From a proposal page, click "Take Quiz"
2. Read each question carefully
3. Select your answers
4. Click "Submit" when finished

### Quiz Results

- If you pass (typically 70% or higher):
  - You'll earn 1 Acent
  - You can now vote directly on the proposal
  - Your comments will be marked as "competent" (no cost to create)
- If you don't pass:
  - You can retake the quiz later
  - You can delegate your vote to someone who has passed
  - You can still comment, but it will cost 3 Dcents

## Delegation System

### When to Delegate

Delegation is useful when:
- You haven't passed the quiz but want your voice counted
- You trust someone else's judgment on a specific proposal
- You don't have time to study the proposal in detail

### How to Delegate Your Vote

1. From a proposal page, click "Delegate Vote"
2. Enter the username or ID of the person you want to delegate to
   (They must have passed the quiz for this proposal)
3. Confirm your delegation
4. You'll earn 1 Dcent for delegating

### Managing Your Delegations

1. Go to your Dashboard
2. View the "Delegations Given" tab
3. You can revoke a delegation at any time, but you'll forfeit the Dcent you earned

### Receiving Delegations

When someone delegates their vote to you:
1. You'll receive a notification
2. When you vote on the proposal, you'll cast your vote plus all delegated votes
3. You'll earn 1 Dcent for each delegation you receive

## Creating Proposals

### Requirements

- You need 5 Acents to create a proposal
- Proposals should be clear, specific, and actionable

### Creating a New Proposal

1. Click "Create Proposal" in the main navigation
2. Fill in the details:
   - Title: A clear, concise summary
   - Content: Detailed description of the proposal
   - Scope: The geographical level this applies to
   - Location information

4. 5 Acents will be deducted from your balance

### Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Active**: Open for voting and discussion
2. **Closed**: Voting period has ended

## Commenting System

### Types of Comments

1. **Competent Comments**: Made by users who have passed the quiz
   - Free to create
   - Marked with a "Competent" badge
   - Higher visibility in discussions

2. **Non-Competent Comments**: Made by users who haven't passed the quiz
   - Cost 3 Dcents to create
   - Can still be valuable and receive upvotes
   - Can be integrated into the proposal if they receive enough support

### Creating Comments

1. Navigate to the proposal you want to comment on
2. Scroll to the comment section
3. Type your comment in the text box
4. Click "Post Comment"
   - If you've passed the quiz, your comment will be posted immediately
   - If you haven't passed the quiz, you'll be asked to confirm spending 3 Dcents

### Voting on Comments

1. Use the thumbs up/down buttons to vote on comments
2. You'll earn 1 Dcent for each vote you cast
3. Comment authors earn 1 Dcent for each upvote they receive

### Comment Integration

If you're the proposal author:
1. You can integrate valuable comments into your proposal
2. Click "Integrate Comment" below any comment
3. The comment author will have some of their Dcents converted to Acents

If your comment receives enough upvotes (around 50% of the proposal's vote count):
1. It may be automatically integrated into the proposal
2. You'll receive Acents as a reward for your valuable contribution

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between Acents and Dcents?

Acents are earned through demonstrating competence (passing quizzes, competent participation) while Dcents are earned through delegation and general participation.

### Can I convert Dcents to Acents directly?

No, the conversion happens only through the comment integration system, when your non-competent comments are recognized as valuable by the community.

### What happens if I run out of Acents or Dcents?

You can always earn more by participating in the platform - passing quizzes, voting, delegating, or receiving upvotes on your comments.

### Can I delegate my vote after passing a quiz?

No, once you've passed a quiz for a proposal, you're expected to vote directly since you've demonstrated competence on the topic.

### How do I know if my comment has been integrated?

You'll receive a notification, and the comment will be marked as "Integrated" on the proposal page. You'll also see the Acent transaction in your history.
