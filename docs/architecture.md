# Change App System Architecture

## Overview

The Change App requires a robust, scalable architecture that can support its complex features while maintaining consistency, security, and performance. After careful consideration of the requirements, this document outlines a modern, cloud-native architecture that balances functionality, cost-effectiveness, and maintainability.

## High-Level Architecture

The Change App will be built using a microservices architecture pattern, which allows for independent scaling and development of different components while maintaining clear boundaries between functional domains. However, to keep costs manageable for an initial implementation, we'll adopt a "modular monolith" approach that can later be decomposed into true microservices as the application grows.

The architecture consists of the following major components:

1. **Frontend Application**: A responsive, single-page application (SPA) that provides the user interface.
2. **Backend API Server**: A RESTful API server that handles all business logic and data access.
3. **Authentication Service**: Manages user identity, authentication, and authorization.
4. **Database Layer**: Stores all persistent data with appropriate schemas and relationships.
5. **Event Bus**: Facilitates communication between components and enables event-driven architecture patterns.
6. **Caching Layer**: Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data.
7. **Background Processing**: Handles asynchronous tasks and scheduled jobs.

### Technology Stack

Based on the requirements and budget constraints, we recommend the following technology stack:

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Redux for state management, and Material-UI for components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with OAuth 2.0 support
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexibility and scalability, with Mongoose ODM
- **Event Bus**: Redis Pub/Sub for lightweight event handling
- **Caching**: Redis for high-performance caching
- **Background Processing**: Bull queue built on Redis
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for consistent environments

This stack provides a good balance of developer productivity, performance, and cost-effectiveness. All components are open-source and have strong community support.

## Detailed Component Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend will be organized using a feature-based structure with the following key components:

1. **Core Components**:
   - Authentication (login, registration, profile)
   - Navigation and layout
   - Notification system

2. **Feature Components**:
   - Proposal creation and viewing
   - Quiz taking interface

### API Endpoints

The API will be organized around RESTful principles with the following major endpoint groups:

1. **Authentication Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/auth/register` - Create new user account
   - `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate user
   - `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile
   - `PUT /api/auth/me` - Update user profile

2. **Proposal Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/proposals` - List proposals with filtering
   - `GET /api/proposals/:id` - Get proposal details
   - `POST /api/proposals` - Create new proposal
   - `PUT /api/proposals/:id` - Update proposal
   - `GET /api/proposals/:id/votes` - Get votes for proposal
   - `GET /api/proposals/:id/comments` - Get comments for proposal

3. **Quiz Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/proposals/:id/quiz` - Get quiz for proposal
   - `POST /api/proposals/:id/quiz/attempts` - Submit quiz attempt
   - `GET /api/users/me/quiz-attempts` - Get user's quiz attempts

4. **Voting Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/proposals/:id/votes` - Cast vote
   - `GET /api/users/me/votes` - Get user's votes

5. **Delegation Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/proposals/:id/delegations` - Create delegation
   - `DELETE /api/proposals/:id/delegations/:delegationId` - Revoke delegation
   - `GET /api/users/me/delegations` - Get user's delegations

6. **Comment Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/proposals/:id/comments` - Create comment
   - `POST /api/comments/:id/votes` - Vote on comment
   - `PUT /api/proposals/:id/comments/:commentId/integrate` - Integrate comment

7. **Token Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/users/me/balance` - Get user's coin balance
   - `GET /api/users/me/transactions` - Get user's transaction history

### Event-Driven Architecture

To maintain consistency and enable scalability, the system will implement an event-driven architecture for certain operations:

1. **Domain Events**:
   - UserRegistered
   - ProposalCreated
   - QuizCompleted
   - VoteCast
   - DelegationCreated
   - DelegationRevoked
   - CommentCreated
   - CommentVoted
   - CommentIntegrated
   - CoinTransactionCompleted

2. **Event Handlers**:
   - Update coin balances based on various actions
   - Recalculate vote totals when new votes are cast
   - Process delegation chains when votes are cast
   - Update proposal status based on vote thresholds
   - Trigger hierarchical scaling when thresholds are met

This event-driven approach allows for loose coupling between components and enables more complex business processes to be modeled as sequences of events.

## Security Architecture

Security is a critical concern for the Change App, particularly for protecting the integrity of voting and the token economy:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - JWT-based authentication with short expiration times
   - Role-based access control for administrative functions
   - Resource-based permissions for user content

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encryption of sensitive data at rest
   - HTTPS for all communications
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)

3. **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**:
   - API rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - CAPTCHA for sensitive operations
   - IP-based blocking for suspicious activity
   - Monitoring and alerting for unusual patterns

4. **Token Economy Protection**:
   - Atomic transactions for coin operations
   - Transaction logs for audit purposes
   - Validation of all economic rules before state changes

## Scalability and Performance

The architecture is designed to scale effectively as the user base grows:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Stateless API servers that can be scaled horizontally
   - Database sharding strategy for future growth
   - Caching layer to reduce database load

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Efficient database indexing
   - Query optimization
   - Pagination for list endpoints
   - Background processing for non-interactive operations

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache proposal data for read-heavy operations
   - Cache user profiles and balances
   - Cache quiz results and vote counts
   - Implement cache invalidation based on events

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture will be designed for reliability and ease of management:

1. **Container-Based Deployment**:
   - Docker containers for consistent environments
   - Docker Compose for local development
   - Kubernetes for production (if budget allows)

2. **Environment Separation**:
   - Development, staging, and production environments
   - Configuration management via environment variables
   - Feature flags for controlled rollout

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Centralized logging with structured log format
   - Performance monitoring and alerting
   - Error tracking and reporting

4. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Regular database backups
   - Point-in-time recovery capability
   - Disaster recovery plan

## Future Scalability Considerations

As the Change App grows, the architecture can evolve in the following ways:

1. **Microservices Decomposition**:
   - Split the modular monolith into true microservices
   - Implement API gateway for routing and aggregation
   - Adopt service mesh for inter-service communication

2. **Advanced Data Processing**:
   - Implement CQRS pattern for complex queries
   - Add analytics capabilities for platform insights
   - Introduce machine learning for content recommendations

3. **Global Distribution**:
   - Deploy to multiple regions for lower latency
   - Implement data replication strategies
   - Address regulatory compliance in different jurisdictions

## Conclusion

The proposed architecture provides a solid foundation for building the Change App while balancing functionality, performance, security, and cost considerations. The modular design allows for incremental development and future expansion as the platform grows in popularity and complexity.

By starting with a modular monolith approach but designing with future microservices in mind, we can deliver a functional system quickly while preserving options for scaling and evolution as the user base grows.
